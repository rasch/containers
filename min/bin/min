# TODO: remove `--no-sandbox` option. The sandbox works fine when using the
# `--cap-add SYS_CHROOT` option as a non-root user. Unfortunately, pulseaudio
# does not work unless root and running as root requires the `--no-sandbox`
# option. This should be safe for now, since I'm running in rootless containers
# on a host with the root account locked. The `xpod` script also drops all
# capabilities and sets strict security-opt.
